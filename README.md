#Learning Scala with Project Euler

I've been interested in picking up Scala for a little while, and have also had some interest in Project Euler as a way to continue working on my programming skills after graduation. Being mathematical in nature, the Project Euler problem-set turned out to be a great match for learning Scala, not to mention making a great refresher on function programming in general.

The code herein is liberally commented (though not consistently) with my thoughts about various aspects of the problems and/or Scala programming language.
